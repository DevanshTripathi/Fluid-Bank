# Fluid-Bank
Here, we Introduce a Fintech Concept of Fluid Banking that will enable everyone to transact, lend or borrow anywhere whenever with anyone they want.

The Idea of Fluidity

Fluid Banking is based on the following Hypothesis - Cash Flows like Water. 

For Fluid Banking every Account is like a Reservoir of Cash and every Transaction is a Stream that connects 2 Reservoir. 

Just like a Reservoir can stream down and lead to various Sub Reservoirs of it, i.e an Account will can have Child Accounts that can be distributed by Account Owner as an alternative to Repeated Transfer of Money to someone. This way the main Account Holder will be updated regarding transactions in the Child accounts and also can disable whenever they want. An Account can also be Public from which anyone can borrow money from without actually knowing them to Defined Limit. 

To Retrieve Money back the Borrower will be by default charged a certain percentage after every Transaction / charged on a regular Periods until the loan is repaid. Thus, with Fluid Banking anyone can Transact anywhere with anyone they want, create Child Account with a certain balance & lend it temporarily or lend Money Securely and get repaid with interest gradually, or borrow money whenever in need and repay it Gradually, easily using Fluid Banking.
